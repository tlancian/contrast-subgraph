_Mining human-brain networks to discover patterns that can be used to discriminate between healthy individuals and patients affected by some neurological disorder, is a fundamental task in neuroscience. Learning simple and interpretable models is as important as mere classification accuracy. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for classifying brain networks based on extracting contrast subgraphs, i.e., a set of vertices whose induced subgraphs are dense in one class of graphs and sparse in the other. We formally define the problem and present an algorithmic solution for extracting contrast subgraphs. We then apply our method to a brain-network dataset consisting of children affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder and children Typically Developed. Our analysis confirms the interestingness of the discovered patterns, which match background knowledge in the neuroscience literature. Further analysis on other classification tasks confirm the simplicity, soundness, and high explainability of our proposal, which also exhibits superior classification accuracy, to more complex state-of-the-art methods._

### Requirements

The code has been tested with:

* Python 2.7
* Matlab R2019a
* CVX
* Networkx==1.9

### Folders
* datasets: datasets listed in Table 1.
* icdm16-egoscan: code of the work by [Cadena et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7837829), released by the authors.

### Execution

In order to run our code, download [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/), unzip the folder and place it in "icdm16-egoscan".

Then, run the following command: 'python cs.py [-h] [-p {1,2}] d a b alpha'

#### Positional arguments:
  * d           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dataset
  * a          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group A
  * b          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group B
  * alpha      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alpha


#### Optional arguments:
  * -h, --help  
    show the help message and exit	
  * -p       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem  
  	Problem Forumlation (default: 1)
  	
#### Examples:
'python cs.py children td asd 0.05'  
'python cs.py adolescents asd td 0.08 -p 2'

:warning: The values of alpha reported in the paper refer to the following quantity: n-th percentile of the distribution of the weights in the difference graphs (TD-ASD and ASD-TD). This choice gives the user an idea on how many edges in the graph are being considered detrimental for the objective function.

We thank Jiaxing Xu (Nanyang Technology University, Singapore) and Yunhan Yang (Auckland University, New Zealand) for noticing that this was not specified in our paper.
